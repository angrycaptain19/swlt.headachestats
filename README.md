# swlt.headachestats

To find out more about your headache, it's often useful to record your symptoms for quite some time.

For this purpose, I'm using Google Forms to be able to easily record symtoms every day.

Later, I want to analyze this data by running over the table, link causalities and calculate what kind of pain is correlated to what kind of behavior pattern, weather phenomenon or whatever.

I'm working on this project whenever I want to, so it will constantly grow, be improved and new features will be added over time.
